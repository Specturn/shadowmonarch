# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical user authentication issue where logging into a different account still displays the previous account's stats, achievements, and personal data. The system needs proper user session isolation to ensure each user only sees their own data and that switching accounts properly clears previous user state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data to be completely isolated from other users, so that when I log into my account I only see my own stats and progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into their account THEN the system SHALL display only that user's personal data
2. WHEN a user switches to a different account THEN the system SHALL completely clear the previous user's data from memory
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all user-specific data from the application state
4. IF a user's data fails to load THEN the system SHALL initialize with default values specific to that user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to properly handle account switching, so that I can switch between different accounts without seeing mixed or cached data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs out and signs into a different account THEN the system SHALL reset all state variables to default values before loading new user data
2. WHEN switching accounts THEN the system SHALL destroy any cached UI components that contain user-specific data
3. WHEN loading a new user's data THEN the system SHALL verify the data belongs to the currently authenticated user
4. IF account switching occurs THEN the system SHALL reinitialize all page modules with clean state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to be properly managed, so that the app correctly identifies which user is currently logged in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the current user context
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL verify the user ID matches the loaded data
3. WHEN authentication fails or expires THEN the system SHALL clear all user data and redirect to login
4. IF multiple authentication events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without data corruption

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal data to persist correctly in the cloud, so that my progress is saved under my account and not mixed with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving user data THEN the system SHALL verify the current user ID before writing to the database
2. WHEN loading user data THEN the system SHALL only load data that belongs to the authenticated user
3. WHEN a user creates new data THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct user ID
4. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling without corrupting user state
