# Enhanced Background Design Requirements

## Introduction

The current application uses simple linear gradients and basic radial gradient overlays for page backgrounds. This enhancement will create sophisticated, dynamic, and visually appealing backgrounds that improve the overall user experience while maintaining performance and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Animated Backgrounds

**User Story:** As a user, I want visually engaging animated backgrounds that enhance the app's aesthetic appeal without being distracting, so that I have a more immersive and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the background SHALL display subtle animated elements that move smoothly
2. WHEN animations are running THEN they SHALL NOT impact app performance or cause frame drops
3. WHEN a user has reduced motion preferences enabled THEN animations SHALL be disabled or significantly reduced
4. WHEN background animations are active THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with text readability or UI element visibility
5. WHEN the page loads THEN background animations SHALL start smoothly without jarring transitions

### Requirement 2: Page-Specific Thematic Backgrounds

**User Story:** As a user, I want each page to have a unique background that reflects its purpose and functionality, so that I can easily identify different sections of the app and feel more engaged with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Dashboard THEN the background SHALL feature tech/data-inspired patterns with blue/purple themes
2. WHEN a user visits the Workout page THEN the background SHALL feature fitness-inspired elements with red/orange themes
3. WHEN a user visits the Gates page THEN the background SHALL feature mystical/RPG-inspired patterns with purple themes
4. WHEN a user visits the Architect page THEN the background SHALL feature construction/building-inspired elements with green themes
5. WHEN a user visits the Achievements page THEN the background SHALL feature trophy/success-inspired patterns with gold/amber themes
6. WHEN a user visits the Settings page THEN the background SHALL feature clean, minimal patterns with neutral themes

### Requirement 3: Layered Visual Depth

**User Story:** As a user, I want backgrounds with multiple layers and depth effects that create a sense of dimension and sophistication, so that the app feels modern and professionally designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the background SHALL have at least 3 distinct visual layers
2. WHEN layers are rendered THEN they SHALL create a parallax-like depth effect
3. WHEN content is displayed THEN background layers SHALL NOT interfere with content readability
4. WHEN layers animate THEN they SHALL move at different speeds to create depth perception
5. WHEN the page resizes THEN all layers SHALL scale appropriately for different screen sizes

### Requirement 4: Interactive Background Elements

**User Story:** As a user, I want subtle interactive background elements that respond to my cursor movement or touch, so that the interface feels more responsive and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their cursor THEN background elements SHALL subtly respond with parallax movement
2. WHEN a user is on a touch device THEN interactive elements SHALL respond to device orientation or touch gestures
3. WHEN interactive elements respond THEN the effect SHALL be subtle and not overwhelming
4. WHEN the user stops interacting THEN elements SHALL smoothly return to their default state
5. WHEN performance is limited THEN interactive effects SHALL be automatically reduced or disabled

### Requirement 5: Geometric and Organic Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want sophisticated background patterns that combine geometric shapes with organic elements, so that the design feels both modern and natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing backgrounds THEN they SHALL include a mix of geometric shapes and organic flowing elements
2. WHEN patterns are displayed THEN they SHALL be mathematically precise yet visually organic
3. WHEN shapes animate THEN they SHALL follow natural movement patterns (easing, curves)
4. WHEN multiple patterns overlap THEN they SHALL create interesting intersection effects
5. WHEN patterns scale THEN they SHALL maintain their visual integrity across all screen sizes

### Requirement 6: Performance and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced backgrounds that don't slow down the app or cause accessibility issues, so that I can enjoy the visual improvements without compromising functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhanced backgrounds are active THEN the app SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN a user has motion sensitivity THEN backgrounds SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
3. WHEN backgrounds are complex THEN they SHALL use GPU acceleration where possible
4. WHEN the device has limited resources THEN background complexity SHALL be automatically reduced
5. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN backgrounds SHALL adjust to maintain accessibility compliance

### Requirement 7: Contextual Color Schemes

**User Story:** As a user, I want background colors and patterns that adapt to the current context and time of day, so that the interface feels more personalized and comfortable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's daytime THEN backgrounds SHALL use brighter, more vibrant color variations
2. WHEN it's nighttime THEN backgrounds SHALL use darker, more muted color variations
3. WHEN a user completes achievements THEN backgrounds SHALL temporarily show celebratory color effects
4. WHEN a user is in focus mode THEN backgrounds SHALL become more subtle and less distracting
5. WHEN system dark/light mode changes THEN backgrounds SHALL adapt accordingly

### Requirement 8: Mobile Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want optimized background designs that look great on smaller screens and don't drain my battery, so that I can enjoy the enhanced visuals without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a mobile device THEN background complexity SHALL be automatically reduced
2. WHEN on a low-power device THEN animations SHALL be simplified or disabled
3. WHEN the screen is small THEN patterns SHALL scale appropriately without losing visual impact
4. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN background responses SHALL be optimized for touch rather than cursor
5. WHEN the device is in battery saver mode THEN background effects SHALL be minimized
