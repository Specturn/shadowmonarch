# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix the startWorkout method to eliminate interface conflicts


  - Remove the conflicting `renderExerciseSelection()` call that populates the static exercise grid
  - Remove the conflicting `showExerciseSelectionScreen()` call that creates overlay content conflicts
  - Implement a single unified exercise selection interface within the workout overlay
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_


- [ ] 2. Create unified exercise selection interface in overlay
  - [ ] 2.1 Implement showExerciseSelectionInOverlay method
    - Create new method that renders exercise selection directly in workout-content div
    - Include exercise grid layout with proper styling and completion status
    - Maintain all existing functionality for exercise progress tracking

    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

  - [ ] 2.2 Update exercise selection rendering logic
    - Modify exercise card generation to work within overlay context
    - Ensure proper event handling for exercise selection clicks
    - Maintain visual indicators for completed, in-progress, and not-started exercises
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_



- [ ] 3. Fix event handling and navigation flow
  - [ ] 3.1 Update exercise selection event handlers
    - Ensure exercise selection clicks work properly within overlay context

    - Fix navigation between exercise selection and individual exercise interfaces
    - Maintain proper state management during interface transitions

    - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3_

  - [x] 3.2 Fix back-to-selection navigation



    - Update back-to-selection button functionality to work with unified interface
    - Ensure proper state preservation when returning to exercise selection


    - Remove references to the old static exercise-selection div
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Clean up redundant interface code
  - [ ] 4.1 Remove unused showExerciseSelectionScreen method
    - Delete the conflicting showExerciseSelectionScreen method
    - Remove any references to the old overlay content rendering
    - Clean up unused event listeners and DOM references
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1_

  - [ ] 4.2 Update progress tracking integration
    - Ensure workout progress updates work with the unified interface
    - Maintain proper exercise completion tracking
    - Verify progress bar updates correctly during exercise selection
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4_

- [ ]* 5. Add error handling and validation
  - Add DOM element existence checks before manipulation
  - Implement fallback behavior for missing overlay elements
  - Add error recovery for interface initialization failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ]* 6. Test interface functionality
  - Test complete workout start to exercise selection flow
  - Verify exercise selection clicks and navigation work properly
  - Test progress tracking and completion status updates
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_
